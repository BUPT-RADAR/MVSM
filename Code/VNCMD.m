function [IFmset IA smset] = VNCMD(s,fs,eIF,alpha,beta,var,tol)
% Variational Nonlinear Chirp Mode Decomposition (VNCMD)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  input %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% s: measured signal,a row vector
% fs: sampling frequency
% eIF: initial instantaneous frequency (IF) time series for all the signal modes; each row of eIF corresponds to the IF of each mode
% alpha: penalty parameter controling the filtering bandwidth of VNCMD;the smaller the alpha is, the narrower the bandwidth would be
% beta: penalty parameter controling the smooth degree of the IF increment during iterations;the smaller the beta is, the more smooth the IF increment would be
% var: the variance of the Gaussian white noise; if we set var to zero, the noise variable u (see the following code) will be dropped.
% tol: tolerance of convergence criterion; typically 1e-7, 1e-8, 1e-9...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% output %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% IFmset: the collection of the obtained IF time series of all the signal modes at each iteration
% smset: the collection of the obtained signal modes at each iteration
% IA: the finally estimated instantaneous amplitudes of the obtained signal modes
